# Tic Tac Toe Engine

I've spent quite a while looking into the minimax algorithm, and its variants like negamax. I've began creating engines for Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4, however I never actually got around to finishing them, so I decided to actually get one finished. This Tic Tac Toe engine is just a simple minimax algorithm implementation, with no alpha-beta pruning (might implement later, however it is a bit unnecessary due to its already fast speeds).
